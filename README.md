## Wii U Virtual Console Boot Resource Database
Wow. What a mouthful. Anyways, this is a repository meant for me to share my custom made resources for Virtual Console injects.

Virtual Console icons look like this.

As you can see, they are very similar to the original Wii U Virtual Console icons, with some additional rounding on the title image.

The boot image, shown below, is also very similar to the original Wii U boot image.

In fact, it is the exact same template.

The main differences come from the gamepad boot image, and the boot sound.
Starting off with the gamepad boot image, it was originally a replica of the TV boot image. Now, it shows a logo of the respective game, on an appropriate background for the console in question.

The boot sound is now unique for each individual console, comparable to the 3DS' Virtual Console service. Obviously, some consoles were not available for the 3DS, and as such, new sounds were in need. The N64 sound is available below.

Of course, this repository is called the Wii U Virtual Console Boot Resource Database, but a separate folder will also be provided for Nintendo Switch RetroArch ROM Forwarders. I suppose consider it "Wii U and Switch Virtual Console Boot Resource Database," or WUSVCBRDB. Still unnecessarily long.
